              My answer to this question in mid-2020 would have been: “I am a
              physicist studying the state of the universe shortly after the big
              bang by analysing data at{" "}
              <a href="https://home.cern/" className="underline">
                CERN
              </a>{" "}
              (the European Council for Nuclear Research)”. Much has happened
              since then, and now I would identify myself as a web developer. It
              is all about my passion for programming. <br />
              As a PhD student and later as a physicist, programming was a daily
              activity for me. If not for work, I would learn something new
              (sometimes just for fun). Nevertheless, coding was only a tool to
              achieve my goals. In the summer of 2020, searching for something
              new to learn, I was introduced to web development on{" "}
              <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" className="underline">
                FreeCodeCamp
              </a>{" "}
              and it just resonated with me! Soon enough, I started asking
              myself, “why don’t I become a full-time web developer ?”

              I spend most of my web development time on the front-end. After
              learning and becoming comfortable with HTML, CSS and JS, I started
              learning React-JS, which I quickly saw its potential. After
              investing considerable time with React, I picked up Next-JS, the
              framework I used to build this website.
              <br /> Along the way, I also became familiar with back-end
              technologies like node-JS and Firebase, which I used to build some
              personal projects.
              <br />
              For me, what makes the web development field so interesting is
              that you don’t stop learning. There is always something that you
              don’t know, which makes it an enjoyable challenge. That said, I am
              confident that I am ready to have a career in this field.
