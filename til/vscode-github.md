You can display a GitHub code in VS Code using the open source library [github1s](https://github.com/conwnet/github1s). You only need to add `1s` after `github` and press Enter in the browser address bar for any repository you want to read.

**Example:**

```css
//github repository
https://github.com/mdtarhini/cheat-sheet-maker

//online vs code viewer
https://github1s.com/mdtarhini/cheat-sheet-maker
```
